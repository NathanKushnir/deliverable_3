        <section class="description">
            <h2>About Michigan Study Spaces</h2>
                <p>Study Spaces at U-M is a tool designed to help you find and reserve designated study spaces, computer stations, a space for you to take a remote class, or just a dedicated quiet touchdown spot between classes. It's understandable that many might be anxious that there aren't many spaces on the site, after going through the last academic year where the primary method of accessing study space was to reserve. As we proceed into the next academic year, several spaces have been designated as open and reservations are not needed. Some units took spaces offline that were offered, as they currently have in-person classes this semester, or an increase in need for event space. </p>
